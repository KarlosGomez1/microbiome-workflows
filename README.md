# metagenomics-workflows


This repository provides workflows, scripts, and examples for metagenomic data analysis, including assembly-based and reads-based approaches.

## This Workflow will perform:

* Pre-processing of reads
* Metagenomic Assembly with spades
* Metagenome binning
* Gene Prediction
* Taxonomic Classification


# 1. Quality Control

This step will remove host reads.
* Requirements:
- Path to directory with paired shotgun sequencing files. 


# 2. Assemble Contigs 

# 3.
